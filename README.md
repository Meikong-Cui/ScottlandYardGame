# Scottland Yard Game

This project is an implementation of the table game 'ScottlandYard' in Java. The skeleton and gui of this project is provided by University of Bristol and the game logic is written by myself. The ai part should use min-max algorithm. However, I did not implement it, currently the ai is just wanderring on the board.

This project is built on IntelliJ and maven. Run the 'Main.java' and a game board will appear. All the art resources are from UoB.
